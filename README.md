### About Subterra
In-situ soil properties estimation and digital soil mapping with Vis-NIR spectroscopy.

Sequestering carbon in the soil has a large potential in mitigating climate change. Monitoring soil carbon stocks is however, very labour expensive as the soil samples have to be collected and sent to the lab and analysed. This Use Case aims to analyse soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks without taking soil samples to the lab. Thus, instead of taking physical soil samples we are taking proximal spectral information of the soil at different soil depths using a probe designed for in situ soil sensing. Based on the spectral pattern we try to estimate the soil carbon concentration. 

The Subterra Green which has been developed by our partners S4 Mobile Laboratories is able to insert a metal rod connected with optical fibers to a Visible and NIR spectrometer, down to 90 cm soil depths, taking spectrum (~330-2580nm) every cm. Currently, we are doing soil measurements by collecting and analysing soil samples for ground truthing. Furthermore, using machine learning approach we can teach a model to estimate the SOC content based on a spectral signal.
